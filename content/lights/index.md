% Lights

I really like creating light shows. I have been slowly improving on a system for synchronizing lights to music for many years. There are two main problems with creating a good light show. The first is the technical challenges of delivering power and data to many different units. The second is the artistic component: how do you create an interface which allows a human to synthesize patterns as effortlessly as possible?

## lux

*lux* aims to solve the technical problems. You can find it written up on Github [here](https://github.com/ervanalb/lux).

*lux* is currently in rev 7. Rev 8 will be a small production run (about 50 units.) It will be used at the [East Side party](http://eastcamp.us/media/albums/view.py?path=REX/2013) at the end of August 2016.

## Radiance

*Radiance* aims to solve the human interface problems. You can find it written up on Github [here](https://github.com/zbanks/radiance). It is currently undergoing a huge rewrite (written up [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rEjWH05oqcs6s1XY8f0MtfnOG9KfiAX3JlBNsiVVWZQ).) Hopefully this will also be done by August.
