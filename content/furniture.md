When I first moved into the Nightosphere in 2014, there was no furniture. Thankfully, EC rush had just finished, so there was free wood. The living room furniture was built entirely with recycled lumber from stuff like the [roller coaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvcMsrUJbiY).

Over the next few years, I continued to build furniture in my basement.

---BREAK---

I have since left the Nightosphere, and all of the furniture except for my bed has been thrown out.

## Kingsman Cabinet

This cabinet holds all my gear. It was inspired by the movie [Kingsman](http://www.moviechambers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Kingsman-The-Secret-Service.jpg).
