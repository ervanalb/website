## Kingsman Cabinet

This cabinet holds all my gear. It was inspired by the movie [Kingsman](http://www.moviechambers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Kingsman-The-Secret-Service.jpg).

## Living room (2014)

When I first moved in to my house, there was no furniture. Thankfully, EC rush had just finished, so there was free wood. All of this furniture was built with recycled lumber from stuff like the [roller coaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvcMsrUJbiY).
