Banks, Maggie and I went to Summerfest at Skydive Chicago,
where we made a bunch of jumps and generally had a great time.
Notably, we put together two [MIT record jumps](https://alum.mit.edu/slice/its-bird-its-plane-its-mit-skydivers)
from the assortment of alums who happened to be attending.

---BREAK---

After assembling the 11-way belly jump,
Banks organized a 5-way head down jump
with myself, Maggie, Swati, and Steve,
with JRuss on camera.
Steve didn't have much head down experience,
so we mostly built around him.
On break-off, he forgot to turn 180 before tracking away
and plowed right into me.
Everyone was fine and we laughed it off on the ground.
He definitely got some shit from JRuss.

I have a handful of videos clips from this event, and will probably post them here eventually.
