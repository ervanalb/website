% Furniture

I don't think of myself as a carpenter or even someone particularly skilled at woodworking, but sometimes it is easier and more fun to build something than to buy it. Plus, then you can make it exactly how you want.

### Kingsman Cabinet

This is still a work in progress. It is going to hold all of my gear (climbing things, skydiving things.) Inspired by the movie [Kingsman](http://www.moviechambers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Kingsman-The-Secret-Service.jpg).

## Round 1 (2014)

When I first moved in to my house, there was no furniture. Thankfully, EC rush had just finished, so there was free wood. All of this furniture was built with recycled lumber from stuff like the [roller coaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvcMsrUJbiY).
