I'm Eric Van Albert. You can email me by replacing the first dot in this domain with @

I live in Massachusetts near Boston. I work at [Vicarious Surgical](http://vicarioussurgical.com/).

I graduated MIT in 2014. I lived in [EC](http://eastcamp.us/) ([Tetazoo](http://tetazoo.scripts.mit.edu/))

I like to work on [projects]({static}/category/projects.html), both [hardware]({static}/tag/hardware.html) and [software]({static}/tag/software.html). I am interested in visual effects [lighting]({static}/tag/lights.html) and [security]({static}/tag/security.html).

I also enjoy going on [adventures]({static}/category/adventures.html). I am a licensed [skydiver]({static}/tag/skydiving.html) and [SCUBA diver]({static}/tag/scuba.html), and enjoy [canyoning]({static}/tag/canyons.html) and climbing.

In Spring 2019, I converted my website into a blog.
Most of the content should be the same.
I tried to accurately back-date articles,
but I may rearrange them or add more.

This website is powered by [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/).
The theme is custom.
You can find the entire source to this website on [Github](https://github.com/ervanalb/website).
