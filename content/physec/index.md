I worked on a project relating to 3D printing keys. You can watch the Defcon talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7v84Ch8sR0) or grab the slides and code [here](https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2021/DEF%20CON%2021%20presentations/Lawrence%20and%20Panel-Updated/). It [got](http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/08/03/mit-students-release-program-to-3d-print-high-security-keys/#209ff7b2da5d) [some](https://keysforge.com/replication-woot15.pdf) [press](https://i.materialise.com/blog/i-materialise-does-not-support-3d-printing-high-security-keys/).

## Contextual Physical Security ##

I co-authored a paper about defeating key systems. You can find it [here](/media/physec/ContextualPhysicalSecurity.pdf).

## One Page Guide to Lockpicking ##

The [MIT Guide to Lockpicking](http://www.capricorn.org/~akira/home/lockpick/) is a great resource, but can be overwhelming to beginners. If you're new to lockpicking, check out my [one-page guide](/media/physec/onepage.pdf).

## Splash Class ##

I [taught a Splash class](https://esp.mit.edu/learn/teachers/ervanalb/bio.html) on physical security. You can find the slide deck [here](/media/physec/SplashPhysicalSecurity.pdf).
