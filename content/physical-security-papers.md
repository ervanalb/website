I am quite interested in physical security and have written a handful of literature on the topic.
---BREAK---

## Contextual Physical Security ##

I co-authored a paper about defeating key systems. You can find it [here]({static}/media/physec/ContextualPhysicalSecurity.pdf).

## One Page Guide to Lockpicking ##

The [MIT Guide to Lockpicking](http://www.capricorn.org/~akira/home/lockpick/) is a great resource, but can be overwhelming to beginners. If you're new to lockpicking, check out my [one-page guide]({static}/media/physec/onepage.pdf).

## Splash Class ##

I [taught a Splash class](https://esp.mit.edu/learn/teachers/ervanalb/bio.html) on physical security. You can find the slide deck [here]({static}/media/physec/SplashPhysicalSecurity.pdf).
